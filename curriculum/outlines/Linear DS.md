# Linear DS
---
## Outline
1. Static Arrays
	 1. Creating 1D, 2D, ND Static Arrays.
	 2. Accessing Time.
	 3. Traversing a Static Array with N dimensions.
	 4. 1D Array Manipulation [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure/)
	 5. 2D Array Manipulation
	 	* Example: Rotating a matrix.
	 6. Pitfalls when creating a static array
	 	* Example: int[] a, b; a = b = new int[10]; will lead to a and b point to same array.
2. Dynamically-Resizeable Array
	 1. Creating ArrayLists , Vectors
	 2. How this is achieved internally , Resizing complexity
	 3. ArrayLists vs Vectores , which is better
	 4. Operations complexity
	 	* Example : add, get,remove
3. BitSet
	1. Operations 
		* Example: reset, set, cardinality , flip, nextSetBit , and, xor
	2. Boolean arrays vs bitsets
	
4. Bitmasks
	1. Bit Manipulation
		* Example: Flipping i-th bit in an integer.
5. LinkedLists
	1. Operations and their Complexity 
	2. Why it is usually avoided
		* Example: A linear scan is needed to access an element
6. Stacks
	1. Operations and their Complexity
		* Example pop, push, peek, empty, search
	2. Applications on Stacks [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/)
7. Queues
	1. Operations and their Complexity
	2. Applications on Queues [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/)
8. Dequeues
   	1. Operations and their Complexity
