# Graph Structure and Traversal
---
## Outline
1. Graph Definition
    1. Representation Forms
        - Mathematical Form
        - Diagrammatic Form
    2. Graph Types
        - Directed vs Undirected
        - Weighted vs Unweighted
        - Simple vs Multi
    3. Important Classes of Graphs
        - Connected Graph
        - Complete Graph
        - Directed Acyclic Graph
        - Bipartite Graph
        - Tree
2. Graph Representation: space and time complexities
    - Adjacency Matrix
    - Adjacency List
    - Edge List
    - Implicit Graphs
3. Graph Traversal
    - Depth-First Search
        - Implementation and Complexity
        - Applications
            * Reachability between two nodes
            * Graph Connectivity
    - Breadth-First Search
        - Implementation and Complexity
        - Applications
            * Reachability between two nodes
            * Graph Connectivity
            * Shortest path in unweighted graph
